## Usage
### Posting commands
Biliomi is a command driven bot. This means that every and all interaction is done via posting commands in the chat or the console.

Commands always start with an exclamation mark (!).

When a command requires arguments you can find out which ones and how by simply posting the base command.<br>
For instance: When you post `!announcement` in the chat, Biliomi will reply with `Usage: !announcement [add|remove|interval|minmsgs] [more...]`.

### The Console
When Biliomi is done booting it will start listening for input in the console.

> known Bugs:
> * Any input always requires [enter] to be pressed.
> * Biliomi's logging can interrupt users typing a command, requiring users to reenter the command.

To find out what commands the console supports, simply type `/help` into the console and press [enter].

Commandline usage:
* Use console: `/[command] [any required parameters]`
* Post commands: `![command] [any required parameters]`
* Send whispers (using bot account): `@[target username] [message...]`
* post message in chat (using bot account): `>[message...]`
