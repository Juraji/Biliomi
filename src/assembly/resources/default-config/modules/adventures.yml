# The adventure supports multiple, randomly selected stories.
# A story consists of a title and chapters. When a story is selected and run biliomi will state the story title and the amount of attendees.
# Chapters are sequentually posted in the chat using the nextChapterInterval as timout between the chapters.
# A chapter can contain a list of {{survivors}} and a list of {{victims}}. {{survivors}} and {{victims}} are randomly chosen and any chapter can contain each of these keys.
# For more information on adventures check the docs
