# You should only change this if you now what you're ding or you're a serious google guru.
# CORS is on by default and will only allow connections locally. If you change the host or the port, change the "corsAllowedOrigin"
# accordingly. The webserver will fail to serve content to origins other than this value.
# Note you can add comma separated origins or use "*" to allow any origin.
