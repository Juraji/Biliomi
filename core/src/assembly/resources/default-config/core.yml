  database:
    # Use a file-based H2 database.
    # If set to true, Biliomi will use a local H2 database for data storage. Other database settings will be ignored.
    # If set to false, Biliomi will try and use the connection info below to connect to a MySQL database.
    # Note: H2 is not recommended for production use as it is VERY slow as opposed to a MySQL server.

    # If you chose to not use the H2 database fill in the the information below.
